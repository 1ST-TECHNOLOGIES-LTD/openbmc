# Needed as a bug workaround -- due to (apparently) a missing pull-up resistor
# on the reset line, u-boot switching the pinctrl when it binds its mmc driver
# glitches the line and resets the host; disabling the driver (which we don't
# need) prevents that.

# Unfortunately the host needs access to the ast2500 Super-IO in order to
# configure the UART for its serial console
